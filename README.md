# Coding Quiz
For the sake of trying to be more succinct, I incorporated JQuery elements to reference HTML elements. Bootstrap was used to create the buttons for each answer choice. 

When the start button is pressed, the first question property of the question object is displayed on the page.

Each answer clicked is recorded as a right or wrong answer.

You can navigate to the High Scores page.

I attempted to manipulate the timer variable to no avail. Timer element was included in grading portion of quiz.

The score alert was meant to be prompted upon clicking the submit button.
